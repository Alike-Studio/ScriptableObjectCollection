## Overview
This sample demonstrate how you can define one of your collections as Addressable and use the new Code Generation API to load and unload it.


## How to use

1. Make sure you have the Addressables package installed on your project
2. Open the `Assets/Samples/Scriptable Object Collection/2.3.1/Addressables Loaded Collection/Scenes/AddressablesLoadedCollectionScene.unity` scene
3. Make sure you set the `Assets/Samples/Scriptable Object Collection/2.3.1/Addressables Loaded Collection/Database` as Addressable
4. Generate the static file using the `Generate Static File` button
5. This should give you access to the static methods to load and unload the collection like the example file `Assets/Samples/Scriptable Object Collection/2.3.1/Addressables Loaded Collection/Scripts/AddressablesExample.cs`
